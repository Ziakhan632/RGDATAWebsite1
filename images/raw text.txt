Managing Staff Alcohol Training. Shop owners must ensure that staff training in alcohol sales is regularly updated and completion of training is recorded. Training will ensure that all staff fully comprehend the law and the procedures and policies about the sale of alcohol.

Ensure staff are aware that all alcohol must be displayed in a separate area of a retail outlet that is separated by a physical barrier which has a minimum height of not less than 1.2 metres and through which alcohol and advertisements for alcohol are not visible. Smaller retail outlets, one or more enclosed adjacent storage units on the shop floor in which the products are not visible up to a minimum height of 1.5 metres.

Have a clear shop policy re checking ID - if in any doubt about whether the customer is old enough, ask for photo ID (Garda Age Card/Passport). If they have no ID, refuse the sale.

Display signs stating that alcohol will not be sold to under-age persons. These signs should be displayed at point of sale in order to remind staff to check a personâ€™s age who is seeking to purchase alcohol.

Monitor and audit staff on a regular basis and maintain a record of all incidents that occur. Up to date records and signed forms re completion of training will assist your defence in court if your shop is prosecuted for staff breaching the law.
